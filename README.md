This is my custom starter kit to the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework bootstrapped with [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)

## Getting Started

In this project you already have:

- app router
- tailwind css
- i18n with Localization
- already configured middleware
- `i18n.config.ts` file for modifying your languages in your application
- translations folder for all of your locales with translations, if you want to add more just add `translations/{locale}.json`
- in `utils` folder all of main files that will be used in your project: `components` for your components, `hooks` for custom hooks, `lib` for third party packages, `styles` folder for your applications styles
- redux toolkit for state management

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
